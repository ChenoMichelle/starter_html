            <p>Pets are a wonderful addition to every home and every family. Whether its a dog, cat, turtle or fish -- we love them like they're
                our own. Below is a gallery of SI 339 Fall 2023 pets and their charecteristics!

    <div> <h2>Hazel</h2>

        <img src="images/hazel.jpg" alt="Yellow Labrador retriever standing in front of a glass door." width="400">

        <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks 
            and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy, 
            so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves 
            meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people, 
            but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.</p>

        <p>Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers, 
            she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some 
            of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets, 
            Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human 
            food such as lettuce.</p>

    <h2>Terry</h2>
    <img src="images/terry_sitting.jpg" width="400" alt="Black dachshund wearing leash and sitting">
    <p>Terry is a playful and spirited dachshund that loves to play fetch with his bone or tennis ball. He loves wandering in forests and finding large sticks to take home. His favorite foods are kibble and peanut butter. Terry will run around frantically when it’s time to eat at home.</p>
    <p>My family found Terry at a shelter and decided to adopt it. He was 4 months old and is now 8 years old. Terry knows how to swim, but we don’t tend to go often. Terry got poison ivy once; however, he quickly recovered and has been doing great since</p>

    <h1>River</h1>

    <img class="Thumbnail"src="images/river.jpg" alt="Fluffy bichon frise wearing santa headband" width="400" class="center">

    <p>River is a 7 year old bichon frise. Though he is aging, he is extremely active and loves to play. 
        He likes to throw things. He will throw his ball down the stairs and play fetch with himself if you don’t
         give him attention. He will also throw his food and water bowl to let us know he wants more. </p>
         
    <p> River is obsessed with my mom. My mom is the one who mostly walks him and gives him treats. 
        Anywhere my mom goes, River follows. If she's gone for 2 minutes, he will frantically search the house 
        for her. Although he likes being with people, he hates being cuddled or held. </p>
